Jetbridge is a simple WebAssembly (WASM) module that allows out-of-process SimConnect modules to act as if they were in-process ones. Specifically, the current development version allows for external modules to dispatch `execute_calculator_code` calls which can be used to read/write `L:` simvars, or even dispatch `H:` events.

#### How does this even work?

Jetbridge establishes a communication protocol using SimConnect's Client Data Areas. It then defines some basic operations that external clients can use, such as calling `execute_calculator_code`. Jetbridge ships with a C++ SDK which defines a Client class which allows the consumer to ...

#### Mâ€™kayâ€¦ But will anyone actually use this?

Jetbridge is currently being used by myself, as well as other [FlyByWire Simulations](https://flybywiresim.com/) developers, to code hardware drivers for the [A32NX](https://github.com/flybywiresim/a32nx). It allows for external programs (such as a hardware driver) to access the inner workings of MSFS in ways not otherwise possible through pure SimConnect.


#### What are all these folders?

Currently, the repo is structured as a single Visual Studio solution, with 4 projects. The `Protocol` project is a C++ static library that defines core protocol entities (e.g. Packet). The `Module` project is the core WASM module and it depends on `Protocol`. The `Client` project is another C++ static library that defines the consumer-facing SDK (i.e. the Client) - it also depends on `Protocol`. Finally, the `Example` project is a simple C++ command line interface executable that shows how Jetbridge can be used by other developers - it of course depends on `Client`, and requires `Module` to be loaded in the simulator.

#### How to use the example

You must first install the Module wasm artifact. You'll have to create a Microsoft Flight Simulator package to do this. If this has been done correctly, you should be able to see an `initialising` message in the MSFS console. Then, simply start the Example.exe artifact. You can then use the CLI to send [Reverse Polish Notation](https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/Additional_Information/Reverse_Polish_Notation.htm) code which will be executed using `execute_calculator_code`. This should look something like this:

Jetbridge is currently at a very early stage of development so bear with us whilst we get everything sorted ðŸ§¸
